# iOS Calculator

This is the first web application I've created using the React.js framework. Able to handle different operations as well as negative numbers and percentages, it is a fully operational calculator that mimics the design and functionality of the calculator app pre-installed in all iOS devices.

## Getting Started

As this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), in the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add button click and toggle animations 
- [ ] Change the clear button to automatically switch between "AC" and "C"
- [ ] Set limit on the amount of characters that can be within the field
